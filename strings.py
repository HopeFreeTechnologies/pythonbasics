#In this file we'll be foucusing on strings; how,  what,  and, and where their used.
#We'll also cover how various operations affect strings and finally we'll also cover the absolute basics as far as arrays are concered with strings
#as well as how to effect the string utilizing the arrays various functions and how operations use them to acheive certain means.

#So starting at the top, what even is a string in the context of Python?
#   A string can be defined in the context of the Python programming language to be a series of characteres incapsulated by quotations.
#
# Note as well that these can be any series of character's. Very similar to your notes (The lines that start with a "#")
# they can contain special characters, operators, even quotes as long as a \ is used to tell python to ignore it and continue the string to it's proper end.
# An example of using a quote in a "string" as defined above is below this line.
# This is a string --> "Because we don't really wanna know what make\'s us hurt eachother!"
# Note that above technically you didn't need to use the \ for the single ' as the string was defined using ""'s
# However we wen't ahead and threw it in as Python shuold ignore the \ in practice and would understand what you where doing in that instance as well.

# Here we're just setting up some variables to use throughout this file in particular :)
# Notice we have a varied diffrent types of useasge within each of these strings
# Almost as if we're trying to re-enforce what's written above lmao

var2 = "Python"

print (" ")

# As you can plainly read above in this section we'll foucs on examples where you change or edit a string within the file itself.
# There are a few (that i currently know of or can think of) reasons one might set out to accomplish this task.
# For example if you needed to make multiple reference to a particularly complex or otherwise convoluted string for whatever reason; then later on in the same program and using the same file; needed to change the reference for a number of possible goals a python program might aim to achive.
# Another, and very likely more common reason, is the string is assigned to a variable that the user defines (user defined variable) and because of which can actively change multiple times.
# As well as many, many more reasons im certain. However I am fairly sure that these reasons will present themselves in subsequent files within the library or in projects we work on later on. If needed however I'll make addendums at the end of this file either refrencing, or importing any examples that are pertinent to this files information as a whole as well as a short explanation as to why that is the case.

# By far the simplest way to modify a string (at least when its assigned to a variable) is to simply redefine the variable that string might ne attached to! Below you can see that the magic man pulls various creatures into his magic hat for you.
