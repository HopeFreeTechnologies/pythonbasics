#So this file has some examples of variables, how they work, and more than just one output (like hi there.py did).

#######################
#
#Below is a variable by the name vname. V for variable and name for, well name.
# Its my first ever variable in Python so by default it's awesome, so i let it know by giving it the value (in the form of a string) awesome lol
#. Note as well that to assign a string to a variable it must still be notated as such eith quotations ^^;
#
#######################

vname = "awesome"
print(vname)

#######################
#
#Variables also have the nifty feature of being capable of changing their assigned value whenever the need arises.
#One of the simplest ways of accomplishing this task is to simply redefine aforementioned value later on inside the same file.
#Like, literally. It can even be immediately following the first value being assigned to it haha
#
#######################

vname = "having all the fun!"
print(vname)

#######################
#
#When the file is compiled (now that the block above has been added) you can see that vname isnt awesome but having all the fun by the second line of output!
#Of course vname can always be awesome again; although you'll have to give it a hand here by running the file a second (or more) time(s) lol
#At their base this is how variables are used. In their simplest format anyways â™¡
