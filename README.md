# pythonbasics
All the files, programs, notes, and assuredly even more; that we've utilized to learn the python programming language whilst adding it to our tool set. ~HFTech.

List of Contents as well as a short description on their purpose.
! Note: Yes, some of these will be pointless or useless in the grand scheme of things.

# hi_there.py
* The quintessential hello world program we all do for every language. We've put a small twist on it by simply making it say "hi there" instead.*

# variables.py
* Another simple file, but with an order of magnitude more in the way of notes. Goes over variables and some of their most simplistic use cases, procedures, etc. Just more Basic’s stuff really. *

# operators.py
* It’s another one of the simpler files going over operations and operator’s that are utilized within python. This is where the syntax first started giving us issues while using various different platforms on which to program. So although extremely simplistic mistakes were being made; extremely long and convoluted notes were left throughout to make sure in the future we took all of this into consideration. *

# strings.py
* This file goes over strings, their uses, and some other things you can do while using them. You can tell we started to get a tad bit bored here (more with the day’s activities if we’re being honest) as we implemented a very short story of a Magic Man and his Magic Hat; you know - just for funsies. Hope it gives you a chuckle ^^
